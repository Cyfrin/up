## Points to remember

* DO NOT CHANGE https://github.com/Cyfrin/up/blob/main/cyfrinup
* DO NOT CHANGE https://github.com/Cyfrin/up/blob/main/install

These files were previsouly downloaded into the existing cyfrinup users' computers. Changing these would **NOT** result in changing those files. Treat these as immutable.

Refer https://github.com/Cyfrin/aderyn/tree/master/cyfrinup to understand how we redirect the old dynamic script to this new dynamic script.

* It only makes sense to allow changes in  `dynamic_script` located here - https://github.com/Cyfrin/up/blob/main/dynamic_script
